Fast selection idea.  Use mouse x and mouse y to create a new
texture (or texture matrix) that is effetively a blue rectangle
(corners based on mouse coords) inside a red square.  Use each point's
x,y coords in active window (where selection is being made) as that
points texture coords in ALL windows.  This can generalized to create
textures (coresponding to soft selections) based on arbirary functions
of coordinates and other (e.g. slider) variables.  E.g. a texture coord
can represent energy, or distance from some n-d point, or how many
times a region has been brushed by an airbrush, etc....

Functionality to add (see also project plan):

***tuning
- remember normalization & ranking
  - don't repeatedly rerank and/or renormalize the same var
  - fast reranking after "delete selected points"?
- don't require multiple copies of vertices
  - interleaved vs. not
- histogram speedups

***misc
- tile windows correctly
- dynamically couple to running sims on another machine(!)

***global controls to non-tabbed panel
- npoints
- start, end, stride for npoints
- random points (repsecting start & end)
- reset all views
- reset selection
- complement selection
- dont display deselected
- add to selection
- subtract from selection
- brush selection
- move selection
- new selection (as opposed to brush or move, works for add & subtract)
- delete selected points
- write data to file

***per-view controls, in tab
- reset view
- selection color (or should this be on global panel?)
- better axis labels
  - labels smaller
  - labels display axis transformations (x+y, polar, normalizations, ranking...)
- tickmarks on axes (per axis?)
- polar grids?
- logarithmic axes
  - via normalzation option
  - show in labels
- atanh (logistic) normalization
- histogram enhancements
  - speed them up when changing bin counts
    - should be very fast for equi-depth case, when data is sorted: O(nbins).
  - histogram bin counts independent for x and y
  - default bin counts using Kevin Knuth's algorithm
  - equi-depth option
  - extend KK's algorithm for equi-depth case
  - offsets for histogram
  - better coloring for histograms 
    - better alphs, or edges on lines
    - colored same as selection color
  - selection via histograms
- boxplots
- density estimates
  - binned kdes?
  - point sprites (same thing?)
- multiple axes
  - ND rotation
- time series
- vector variables
- rework normalization
  - separate scaling, centering, windowing
  - separate axes and windowing ?

***plot window enhancements
- tie plot window keys to tab keys (shortcuts?), where possible
- trackballs for 3d rotation
- scale w.r.t. mouse down as center
- move point to center ?
  - show center glyph, like flashearth
- lock aspect ratio to 1:1
  - even when window aspect ratio is not 1:1
- fancy texture hacking, as above

***additional kinds of vis
- parallel coordinates
- vectors
- glyphs
- color by scalar
- MDS
- laplacian eigenmaps, LLE, other dim. reduction....
- classification (SOM....)
