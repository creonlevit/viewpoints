Fast selection idea.  Use mouse x and mouse y to create a new
texture (or texture matrix) that is effetively a blue rectangle
(corners based on mouse coords) inside a red square.  Use each point's
x,y coords in active window (where selection is being made) as that
points texture coords in ALL windows.  This can generalized to create
textures (coresponding to soft selections) based on arbirary functions
of coordinates and other (e.g. slider) variables.  E.g. a texture coord
can represent energy, or distance from some n-d point, or how many
times a region has been brushed by an airbrush, etc....
