Step 1

download the latest stable fltk-1.3 from http://fltk.org/software.php
  (vp does not work with fltk 2.0)
expand
cd
./configure 
  (use "./configure --enable-quartz" on mac)
make
sudo make install


Step 2

download flews from http://dbarrero.tripod.com/software/flews-0.3.tar.gz
expand
cd
./configure
edit source code to remove bogus "include <values.h>" if necessary
make  
  don't worry if flews test doesn't link.  it is not necessary for vp.  
  If you want to test flews, edit the flews makefile to have the correct locations
sudo make install


Step 3

download the latest bltiz from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=63961
expand
./configure
make lib
make check-testsuite  (see if all tests pass)
sudo make install


Step 4

download the lastest gsl from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/
./configure --disable-shared
make
make check  (see if all tests pass)
sudo make install


Step 5

Download and install boost, see: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html
Since vp uses the boost serialization library, you do have to build boost.  The "header only" libraries are not adequate.


Step 6

svn -checkout (or -update) latest vp sources from http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/viewpoints
edit your makefile for appropriate machine/OS/debugging combination
make


Step 7

test vp


Step 8

Do some real work.
