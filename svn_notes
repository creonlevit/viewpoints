This aassumes I will be running the svn server (svnserve) and keeping my
repository (repositories) on the same machine that I am doing my
work.

1) install subversion (./configure --without-berkeley-db )
3) Make sure the svnadmin deamon is running ("svnserv -d" see svnserve(8))
4) Make that any firewall I am running allows connections to the svnserv port

5) make a directory to hold repositories (master databases of all
   revisions for my projects under subversion revision control).  I
   only do this once.  It can be anywhere.  E.g:

% mkdir ~/SVN-Repository/

6) to create a repository for a project (e.g. "grid2") that I would
   like to bring under subversion's revision control execute the
   command:   

% svnadmin create ~/SVN-Repository/grid2

7) to import the (previously uncontrolled) source code for this
   project (grid2) along with its auxillary files (data, text,
   Makefile, notes, subdirectories, etc) I make a temporary copy of my
   files, e.g: 

% cp -rp ~/src/grid2 ~/src/grid2.xxx
% cd ~/src/grid2.xxx

8) clean up the directory (grid2.xxx) getting rid of cruft, huge data
   files, including cruft in subdirectories. 

9) Then import the whole (clean) directory heirarchy into the
   repository.  We only do this once (per project): 

% svn import . svn://creon@localhost/Users/creon/SVN-Repository/grid2 -m "initial checkin of grid2"

9) Now we can delete the grid2.xxx directory

% cd ..
% rm -rf grid2.xxx

10) Save the original source code directory, for peace of mind. (not
    really necessary):

% mv grid2 grid2.pre_svn

11) Make a new grid2 directory where we will store our working copy
    and do all our work from now on:

% mkdir grid2
% cd grid2

12) Now check out a working copy from the repository and get to work:

% svn checkout svn://creon@localhost/Users/creon/SVN-Repository/grid2 .

% emacs grid2.cc ......

13) from now use svn {status, update, checkin} in the work cycle.

Possible problems:

Make sure the svnserve.conf file in the repository allows write
access, e.g:

# in /Users/creon/SVN-Repository/grid2/svnserve.conf
#
[general]
anon-access = write
auth-access = write
#
