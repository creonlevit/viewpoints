1. selected set is random garbage after startup, or after read cfile.  
   *fixed*
   BROKEN AGAIN (when reading files from mnu on OSX)!!!!

2. color selection from master tab pops up nplots separate color dialogs!
   *fixed*

3. selectin -nothing- as x or y axis causes core dump.
   *fixed*

4. selecting "sum vs. diff" from master tab causes core dump.
   *fixed* (disabled, actually)

5. plots are not redrawn after "read data"

6. when a window is spinning, selecting points in any previous (smaller index) window does not work.

7. When clicking on tab, coresponding plot window should be raised (not globally).

8. selected set still garbage on startup.
   *fixed* (see note to Paul at end of main() )
   
9. help files not in mac & linux releases (?)
   *fix

10. mac releases way out of date.
   *fixed*

11. reset view button sometimes fails

12. file with bad data on every line should abort after reading n<1000 lines
   *fixed*

13. web site does not mention scatterplots, linked scatterplots, histograms, openGL, or "creon levit".  It should mention these things before we (re)submit it to google.  see http://trotsky.arc.nasa.gov/wacowiki/index.php/Viewpoints
   *fixed*

14. web site title/tag should be "viewpoints - interactive linked scatterplots and more".  Not "hyperwall for the masses".  see http://trotsky.arc.nasa.gov/wacowiki/index.php/Viewpoints
   *fixed*

14. Windows version seems to install executable deep in a folder (from whence it must be removed).  This may have been my installation error.   *fixed*

15. selected portion of histogram gets redrawn incorrectly when "invert selection" is called.

16. x-axis normalizaitions log10, threesigma, and squash(?) seem to be broken.  y axis is fine.
    *fixed*

17. --borderless option (at least on OSX) causes plot windows to ignore keyboard events (but not mouse events!)

18. plots are not redrawn after global "unselected color" is changed.

19. selection color is not settable globally (this is deliberate, but should be fixed)

20. Code is not formatted consistently.  
    1) Consider using gnu standard coding style, or fltk standard coding style?
    2) No tabs allowed - only spaces.

21. "invert selection" tice does not correctly restore slections in multiple colors

22. aborts should produce backtraces?
