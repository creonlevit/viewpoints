1. selected set is random garbage after startup.  
   *fixed*

2. color selection from master tab pops up nplots separate color dialogs!
   *fixed*

3. selectin -nothing- as x or y axis causes core dump.
   *fixed*

4. selecting "sum vs. diff" from master tab causes core dump.
   *fixed* (disabled, actually)

5. plots are not redrawn after "read data"

6. when a window is spinning, selecting points in any previous (smaller index) window does not work.

7. When clicking on tab, coresponding plot window should be raised (not globally).

8. selected set still garbage on startup.
   *fixed* (see note to Paul at end of main() )
   
9. help files not in mac & linux releases (?)

10. mac releases way out of date.

11. reset view button sometimes fails

12. file with bad data on every line should abort after reading n<1000 lines

13. web site does not mention scatterplots, linked scatterplots, histograms, openGL, or "creon levit".  It should mention these things before we (re)submit it to google.  see http://trotsky.arc.nasa.gov/wacowiki/index.php/Viewpoints

14. web site title/tag should be "viewpoints - interactive linked scatterplots and more".  Not "hyperwall for the masses".  see http://trotsky.arc.nasa.gov/wacowiki/index.php/Viewpoints

14. Windows version seems to install executable deep in a folder (from whence it must be removed).  This may have been my installation error.

15. selected portion of histogram gets redrawn incorrectly when "invert selection" is called.

16. x-axis normalizaitions log10, threesigma, and squash(?) seem to be broken.  y axis is fine.
    *fixed*
