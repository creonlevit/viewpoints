<a name="Overview"></a>
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
<em><b>Viewpoints</b></em> is a high-performance visualization and analysis 
tool for large, complex, multidimensional data sets.  It generates multiple 
linked scatterplots (millions of points in 2D & 3D) with overplotting and 
brushing.  It supports histograms with dynamically adjustable binwidth. It 
supports several common types of normalization (linear, logarithmic, logistic, 
trimmed, etc), equalization (gaussian, uniform, etc), and rudimentary outlier 
detection and forward search.
</p>

<p>
<em><b>Viewpoints</b></em> is designed to take advantage of the hardware 
accelerated graphics and fast processors on modern high-end workstations and 
laptops.  It is highly interactive, so that most parameters are modifiable in 
real time with immediate visual feedback. It allows interactive exploration 
of data in 100 or more dimensions with sample counts, or the number of points, 
exceeding 10e6 (up to 10e8 depending on available RAM). 
</p>

<a name="Data_Formats"></a>
<h3>Data Formats and Organization</h3>

<p>
<em>Viewpoints</em> can read data from ASCII or binary files.  ASCII files
consist of zero or more <em>header lines</em> (indicated by comment 
characters '!#%') followed by a <em>data block</em> that consists of a line 
of column labels followed by successive lines of data.  The column labels 
and data words can be delimited by a user-defined character.  Note that the
line of column labels is <em>not</em> preceded by a comment character unless
this specified by the user.
</p>

<p>
Binary files consist of a single record containing column information 
followed by a block of binary words in column- or row-major organization.
The default is column-major organization, in which successive words 
represent successive values on a row.
</p>

<a name="Configuration_Files"></a>
<h3>Saving and Loading Configuration Information</h3>

<p>
<em><b>Viewpoint</b></em> can save basic configuration information, such as 
axis settings, window positions, and the name of the last input or output 
data file, to a configuration file for later reuse.  <em><b>Note that this 
process does not save the actual data or selection information 
itself!</b></em>
If it did, this would produce unnecessary copies of the data files!  The
user must save any new or modified data they wish to associate with a 
configuration before they save that configuration.
<\p>

<a name="Usage"></a>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
When <em><b>viewpoints</b></em> is invoked from the <em><b>vp</b></em> icon, 
it displays a control panel at the far right along with a 2x2 array of 
linked scatter plots of default data.  These windows can be moved and resized 
in the conventional fashion.  If you delete some window by accident, you can 
restore every window using the <em>View|Restore Panels</em> command from the 
main menu bar.  
(WARNING: In the current version of <em><b>viewpoints</b></em>', if you 
delete every plot window, bad things may happen.  This will be fixed in 
future releases.)
</p>

<p>
You can select and move between windows by clicking on them in the 
conventional fashion.  You can also select a particular plot window by 
clicking on the associated tab in the control panel window.  Within 
different windows, you can use the mouse to select portions of the data set.  
It is in this feature that the power of <em><b>viewpoints</b></em> resides.  
Rather than attempt to describe it in detail, we encourage you to experiment.

<a name="Control_Panels"></a>
<h3>Controls in the control panels</h3>

<p>
The control panel consists of a set of tabbed control panels for individual 
<em>windows</em>, tabbed control panels for individual <em>brushes</em>, 
and a main control panel for the entire array of panels.  For the most part, 
these controls should be intuitive. Some of these controls are described 
below.

<a name="Notes_And_Warnings"></a>
<h3>Notes and warnings:</h3>

<p>
The current release of the 'viewpoints' package (version 2.0.4, build 218) 
is still a development version.  While every effort has been make to ensure 
that it will work -- or fail gracefully if it doesn't -- it still has many 
rough edges.  Some of these are described below.  These issues will all be 
addressed in future releases.
<\p>

<p>
1) If you drag a window over the main control panel, the main control panel
may need to be refreshed.  This can be accomplished by resizing it.

<p>
2) The Load and Save Configuration commands are a comparatively new feature,
and save basic session information.  They may not work on every system.  
Also, there is not, as yet, any guarantee that old configuration files will
be upward-compatible with new versions of viewpoints.
<\p>

<p>
3) The Edit Column Labels tool is also a new feature, and is not guaranteed
to preserve axis or scaling information.  In the current release, it can only
delete labels.  Column labels of ASCII files can be renamed via by using an
editor in a conventional fashion.  Small binary files can be saved to ASCII 
and edited.  For large binary files, it is possible, with difficulty, to 
rename labels by saving a small portion of the file as ASCII, editing this, 
reloading it, and appending the remainding portion of the original binary file.
<\p>

<a name="Compatibility_Issues"></a>
<p>
<b>Compatibility:</b> The Linux version has been tested on Fedora
Core 4 while the MacOS versions have been tested on MacOS 10.4.8 on G4,
G5 and intel macs.  The Windows version should run on any recent
system with the necessary functionality from OpenGL 1.2 through 1.6.  
It will not run on older systems that are restricted to OpenGL 1.1.
</p>

<p>
Please note that <b><em>Viewpoints</em> (vp)</b> is in development.
While each version is tested before release to make certain 
that it will function properly (or fail gracefully in the event  
something goes wrong), we are continuing to updated and modify the 
package and add features in response to experience, suggestions, and 
the requirements of the user community.  For detailed information
about this release see the README file.  If you have any comments or
suggestions, please feel free to contact the project team:
<a href="mailto:creon.levit@nasa.gov">Creon Levit</a> or
<a href="mailto:Paul.R.Gazis@nasa.gov">Paul R. Gazis</a>.

it if you could acknowledge this project in the relevant publications.
Thank you.
