<h3>Keys & Buttons in plot windows:</h3>

<p>
The following mouse key and button combinations can be used 
while the cursor is postioned above a plot window
</p>

<table align="LEFT">
<tr>
 <th align="LEFT">Action</th><th align="LEFT">Key</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>new selection</td><td>left-mouse</td>
</tr>

<h3>Mouse Gestures in plot windows:</h3>

<p>
Mouse key and gesture combinations wil ave the following effects
when the cursor is positioned over a plot window.

<table align="LEFT">
<tr>
 <th align="LEFT">Action</th><th align="LEFT">Gesture</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>select points</td><td>left-mouse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>drag selection</td><td>shift + left-mouse</td>

 <td>translate</td><td>right-mouse  (opt-mouse on OSX)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>scale</td><td>middle-mouse (ctl-mouse on OSX)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>scale histogram</td><td>middle-mouse + h (ctl-mouse + h on OSX)</td>
</tr>

<h3>Controls in control panels:</h3>

<p>
Controls in the tabbed and main control panels will have the
following effects.
</p>

<table align="LEFT">
<tr>
 <th align="LEFT">Control</th><th align="LEFT">Action</th>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>npoints</td><td>number of points displayed</td>

<h3>Normalization Schemes</h3>

<p>Several different normalzation or scaling schemes are available.
These are chosen on a per-axis basis.

<table align="LEFT">
<tr>
 <th align="LEFT">Scheme</th><th align="LEFT">Effect</th>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>none</td><td>show all data, center of window at median</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>zeromax</td><td>show all positive data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>maxabs</td><td>show all data, center of window at zero</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>threesigma</td><td>center of window at sample mean, window spans +/- three sigma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>rank</td>
 <td>plot rank of x (instead of x)<br>(i.e. nonuniform rescaling to force uniform marginal)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>gaussianize</td>
 <td>plot inverse of Gaussian cummulative distribution function of x<br>(i.e. nonuniform rescaling to force Gaussian marginal)</td>
</tr>

Please note that <b><em>Viewpoints</em> (vp)</b> is a development 
routine.  While each version is tested before release to make certain 
that it will function properly (or fail gracefully in the event  
something goes wrong), we are continuing to updated and modify the 
package and add features in response to experience, suggestions, and 
the requirements of the user community.  If you have any comments or
suggestions, please feel free to contact the project team:

This project was funded by a grant from NASA's
Applied Information Systems Research Program.
If you find this package useful in your research, we would appreciate 
it if you could acknowledge this project in the relevant publications.
Thank you.

<p>
<b>Compatibility:</b> The Linux version has been tested on Fedora
Core 4 while the MacOS versions have been tested on MacOS G4 and
G5, respectively.  The Windows version should run on any recent
system with the necessary functionality from OpenGL 1.2 through 1.6.  
It will not run on older systems that are restricted to OpenGL 1.1.
