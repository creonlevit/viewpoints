<hr>

<p>
When <em><b>viewpoints</b></em> is invoked from the 
<em><b>vp</b></em> icon, it display a control panel along with 
an 2x2 array of linked scatter plots of default data.  These 
windows can be moved and resized in the conventional fashion.  
If you delete some window by accident, you can restore every 
window using the <em>reload plots</em> command from the command
window.  (WARNING: In the current version of 
<em><b>viewpoints</b></em>', if you delete every plot window, 
bad things may happen.  This will be fixed in future releases.)
</p>

<p>
You can select and move between windows by clicking on them in 
the conventional fashion.  You can also select a particular 
plot window by clicking on the associated tab in the control 
panel window.  Within different windows, you can use the mouse 
to select portions of the data set.  It is in this feature that 
the power of <em><b>viewpoints</b></em> resides.  Rather than 
attempt to describe it in detail, we encourage you to experiment.

<h3>Controls in the control panels</h3>

<p>
The control panel consists of a set of tabbed control panels for
individual windows and a main control panel for the entire array
of panels.  For the most part, these controls should be intuitive.
Some of these controls are described below

<table>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Tabbed control panels</td></tr>

 <th align="LEFT">Control</th><th align="LEFT">Action</th>
</tr>
<tr>

<h3>Normalization Schemes</h3>

Please note that <b><em>Viewpoints</em> (vp)</b> is a development 
routine.  While each version is tested before release to make certain 
that it will function properly (or fail gracefully in the event  
something goes wrong), we are continuing to updated and modify the 
package and add features in response to experience, suggestions, and 
the requirements of the user community.  If you have any comments or
suggestions, please feel free to contact the project team:
<a href="mailto:creon.levit@nasa.gov">Creon Levit</a> or

This project was funded by a grant from NASA's
Applied Information Systems Research Program.
If you find this package useful in your research, we would appreciate 
it if you could acknowledge this project in the relevant publications.
Thank you.

<p>
<b>Compatibility:</b> The Linux version has been tested on Fedora
Core 4 while the MacOS versions have been tested on MacOS G4 and
G5, respectively.  The Windows version should run on any recent
system with the necessary functionality from OpenGL 1.2 through 1.6.  
It will not run on older systems that are restricted to OpenGL 1.1.
