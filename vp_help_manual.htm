<hr>

<p>
When <em><b>viewpoints</b></em> is invoked from the 
<em><b>vp</b></em> icon, it displays a control panel at the far right
along with 
a 2x2 array of linked scatter plots of default data.  These 
windows can be moved and resized in the conventional fashion.  
If you delete some window by accident, you can restore every 
window using the <em>reload plots</em> command from the command
window.  (WARNING: In the current version of 
<em><b>viewpoints</b></em>', if you delete every plot window, 
bad things may happen.  This will be fixed in future releases.)
</p>

<p>
You can select and move between windows by clicking on them in 
the conventional fashion.  You can also select a particular 
plot window by clicking on the associated tab in the control 
panel window.  Within different windows, you can use the mouse 
to select portions of the data set.  It is in this feature that 
the power of <em><b>viewpoints</b></em> resides.  Rather than 
attempt to describe it in detail, we encourage you to experiment.
</p>

<h3>Mouse Gestures in plot windows:</h3>

<p>
Mouse gestures combinations have the following effects
when the window manager focus is on a plot window.
<table>
<tr>
 <th align="LEFT">Action</th><th align="LEFT">Gesture</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>select points</td><td>left-mouse</td>

<h3>Controls in the control panels</h3>

<p>
The control panel consists of a set of tabbed control panels for
individual windows and a main control panel for the entire array
of panels.  For the most part, these controls should be intuitive.
Some of these controls are described below

<table>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Tabbed control panels</td></tr>
<tr>
 <th align="LEFT">Control</th><th align="LEFT">Action</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>size</td><td>size of non-selected points, in pixels</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<tr>
 <td>size2</td><td>size of selected points, in pixels</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>symbol</td><td>plot all points using this symbol</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Bkg</td><td>background color (try bkg=0.5, lum2=0.2)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Lum</td><td>successive brightness increase for overplotting</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Lum2</td><td>base brightness of a single point before overplotting</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Alph</td><td>point opacity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td valign="TOP">rot</td>
 <td>rotation angle in 3D about the y-axis.&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: to take<br>
 advantage of this feature one must first select something<br>
 for the 3rd axis to display.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>nbins</td><td>number of histogram bins</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>axis 1-3</td><td>Attribute to be displayed in that axis</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>lock axes</td><td>Lock an axis so it won't change when invoking "change axes"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>normalize x,y,z</td><td>Normalization scheme for that axis</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>reset view</td><td>Reset rotation and other display params</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td valign="TOP">spin</td>
 <td>continuous rotation about the y-axis.&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: to start<br>
 this, you may have to give the <em>rot</em> slider a twitch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>don't clear</td><td>Don't clear selected points in this panel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>identify</td><td>plot y vs x</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>sum vs. diff plot</td><td>plot (x+y) vs. (x-y)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>polar</td><td>plot x<-r, y<-theta</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>points</td><td>Show data points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>unselected</td><td>Show unselected data points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>axes</td><td>Show axes</td>

</p>

<p>
<table>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Main control panel</td></tr>
<tr>
 <th align="LEFT">Control</th><th align="LEFT">Action</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>show nonselected</td><td>Show/don't show unselected points in all plots</td>

</table>
</p>

<h3>Normalization Schemes</h3>

<p>Several different normalization or scaling schemes are available.
These are chosen on a per-axis basis.
<table>
<tr>
 <th align="LEFT">Scheme</th><th align="LEFT">Effect</th>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>none</td><td>show all data, center of window at median</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>zeromax</td><td>show all positive data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>maxabs</td><td>show all data, center of window at data zero</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>trim 10<sup>-2</sup></td>
 <td>Window spans 1st to 99th percentile</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>trim 10<sup>-3</sup></td>
 <td>Window spans 0.1th to 99.9th percentile</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>threesigma</td><td>center of window at sample mean, window spans +/- three sigma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>log_10</td>
 <td>Logarithmic axis</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>squash</td>
 <td>Simple sigmoid</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>rank<br>&nbsp;</td>
 <td>plot rank of x (instead of x)<br>(i.e. nonuniform rescaling to force uniform marginal)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>gaussianize<br>&nbsp;</td>
 <td>plot inverse of Gaussian cummulative distribution function of x<br>(i.e. nonuniform rescaling to force Gaussian marginal)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3>Keys & Buttons in plot windows:</h3>

<p>
The following keyboard shortcuts can be used 
while the window manager focus is on a plot window:
<table>
<tr>
 <th align="LEFT">Action</th><th align="LEFT">Key</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>invert selection</td><td>i</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>display deselected</td><td>d</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>clear selection</td><td>c</td>

<p>
Please note that <b><em>Viewpoints</em> (vp)</b> is in development.
While each version is tested before release to make certain 
that it will function properly (or fail gracefully in the event  
something goes wrong), we are continuing to updated and modify the 
package and add features in response to experience, suggestions, and 
the requirements of the user community.  If you have any comments or
suggestions, please feel free to contact the project team:
<a href="mailto:creon.levit@nasa.gov">Creon Levit</a> or
<a href="mailto:pgazis@mail.arc.nasa.gov">Paul R. Gazis</a>.
</p>

<p>
This project was funded by a grant from NASA's
Applied Information Systems Research Program.
If you find this package useful in your research, we would appreciate 
it if you could acknowledge this project in the relevant publications.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Compatibility:</b> The Linux version has been tested on Fedora
Core 4 while the MacOS versions have been tested on MacOS 10.4.8 on G4,
G5 and intel macs.  The Windows version should run on any recent
system with the necessary functionality from OpenGL 1.2 through 1.6.  
It will not run on older systems that are restricted to OpenGL 1.1.
