viewpoints -- Fast interactive plotting of extremely large
  multivariate data sets.

Version: 1.1.0  (Build 101)
Release date: 25-OCT-2006
  

Overview:

The archives on this site contains the executable, documentation,
a sample data file with examples, and any dynamic link libraries 
(dlls) that may be required for the 'viewpoints' (vp) package for
Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.  The contents of these archives are 
listed below:

Installation:

Unpack these files into a target directory, then either click on 
the 'vp' icon or run the code from the command line as described 
below.


Usage:

In its current form (Version 1.0.3, build 69) 'viewpoints' is run 
either by clicking on the 'vp' icon or from the command line in 
the directory in which it has been installed or to which a path is 
available.  When viewpoints is run from the icon, it will come up
with an array of default data.  When it is run from the command
line, the user must specify the input data file explicitly.

The calling sequence for the command line version is:

 vp [optional arguments] inputfile

 the optional arguments are:

  --format=ascii (default) [shortcut: -f a]
    Read an ASCII input file that consists of a header block 
    followed by a data block.  Lines in the header block are 
    indicated by one the comment characters '!', '#', or '%'.  In 
    the absence of comment characters, the header block consists of
    a number of lines specified by the '--skip_header' command 
    below, with a default value of 1 line.  The final line of the 
    header contains the attribute names, whitespace delimited.  
    Successive lines in the data block contain the numeric 
    attribute values for successive samples, whitespace delimited.

  --format=binary [shortcut: -f b]
    Read a binary input file.  The first record of this file 
    consists of a line of ASCII attribute names, whitespace 
    delimited, ending with newline (\n).  This is followed by a
    contiguous block that contains a table of binary floating 
    point values.

  --skip_header=<integer> [shortcut: -s <int>] (default 1)
    Specifies the number of lines that will be assigned to the 
    header block in the absence of comment characters.

  --npoints=<integer> [shortcut: -n <int>] (default all)
    Specifies the number of samples (records or rows in the data
    block of an ASCII file) to read.  

  --rows=<integer> [shortcut: -r <int>] (default 2)
    Specifies the number of rows of scatterplots

  --cols=<integer> [shortcut: -c <int>] (default 2)
    Specifies the number of columns of scatterplots

  --input_file=<filespec> [shortcut: -i <filespec>]
    Filespec of the input file.  NOTE: if this parameter is not
    specified, the code will assume that the final token in the
    command line is the input filespec.

  --borderless [shortcut: -b]
    Attempt to maximize plot windows' usable area by removing 
    window manager decorations.  Note: this seems to cause problems
    with keyboard shortcuts in plot windows under Mac OSX.

  --help [shortcut: -h]
    Print a short help message.

  --ordering={rowmajor,columnmajor}
    ordering for binary data, default=columnmajor

  --nvars [shortcut -v <int>]
       input has NVARS values per point (only for row major binary data)

  --delimiter [shortcut -d=<char>]
    interpret CHAR as field separator, default is whitespace.

  --missing_values [shortcut -M <number>]
    set the value of any unreadable, nonnumeric, empty, or missing values to NUMBER, default=0.0

  --no_vbo [shortcut -B]
    don't use openGL vertex buffer objects.  Useful if you have an older graphics card or if
    the graphics are inconsistent or are very slow.

  --version [shortcut -V]
    print version information and then exit.

  --help [shortcut -h]
    print out brief usage message and then exit.


When 'viewpoints' is invoked, it will read the input file, then
display a control panel along with an 'r' x 'c' array of linked 
scatter plots.  These windows can be moved and resized in the
conventional fashion.  If you delete some window by accident, 
you can restore every window using the 'reload plots' command.
WARNING: In the current version of 'viewpoints', if you delete 
EVERY plot window, bad things may happen.  This will be changed 
in future releases.

You can select and move between windows by clicking on them in 
the conventional fashion for your OS.  You can also select a 
particular plot window by clicking on the associated tab in the
control panel window as described below.  Within different 
windows, you can use the mouse to select portions of the data 
set.  It is in this feature that the power of 'viewpoints' 
resides.  Rather than attempt to describe it in detail, we 
encourage you to experiment.

Controls in the control panels:

 The control panel consists of a set of tabbed control panels for
 individual windows and a main control panel for the entire array
 of panels.  For the most part, these controls should be intuitive.
 Some of these controls are described below:

Normalization schemes (per axis)

 Data can be normalized in several different ways.  The
 normalization scheme for any axis can be selected from the 
 appropriate menu.

  type                   description
  --------------------   -----------
  none                   show all data, center of window at median
  minmax                 window spans maimimum to maximum.
  zeromax                show all positive data
  maxabs                 show all data, center the window at zero
  trim 10^-2             window spans the 1st-99th percentile
  trim 10^-3             window spans the 0.1th-99.9th percentile
  threesigma             center window at sample mean so that 
                         window spans +/- three sigma.
  log_10                 Logarithmic axis
  squash                 Simple sigmoid
  rank                   plot rank (order) of x instead of x -- 
                         i.e. nonuniform rescaling to force a 
                         uniform marginal
  gaussianize            plot inverse of the Gaussian cummulative 
                         distribution function of x -- i.e. 
                         nonuniform rescaling to force a uniform 
                         marginal


Notes and warnings:

The current release of the 'viewpoints' package (version 1.1.0, 
build 93) is still a development version.  While every effort has 
been make to ensure that it will work -- or fail gracefully if it 
doesn't -- it still has many rough edges.  Some of these are
described below.  These issues will all be addressed in future
releases.

1) The current release can only write binary files.  Future 
releases will have the ability to write ASCII files complete with
copies of the saved header.

2) There is, as yet, no 'print' command.  Needless to say, this 
capability will be added as soon as possible!
