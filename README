Preface:

Please let us know how viewpoints helps you. Did it enable you to solve a
problem?  To make a discovery?  To find an error?  To generate a figure for 
a paper?  The more we know that viewpoints is useful, the more time we'll 
spend working on it.  


Overview:

Each archive on this site contains the  viewpoints (vp) executable, 
documentation, a sample data file with examples, and for MS Windows, any 
dynamic link libraries (dlls) that may be required by the package.  The 
contents of these archives are listed below:

Installation:

Unpack these files into a target directory, then either click on the 'vp' 
icon or run the code from the command line as described below.

Data Organization and Format:

Viewpoints can read and write data from ASCII or binary files.  ASCII files 
consist of zero of more header lines, indicated by comment characters '!#&%', 
followed by a data block.  The data block is assumed to consist of a line of 
column labels followed by successive lines of data.  Words in the data block 
can be delimited by whitespace or some user-defined character.  Binary files
conists of a line of column label information followed by a block of binary
data in row- or column-major format.  Note that the line of column labels 
must NOT be preceded by a comment character unless they are specified by the
user to be part of the header.

Data can also be read directly from the input line using the --stdin command
line option described below.  This allows piping on systems that support it,
which allows the user to use a wide variety of third-party applications to
read or process different data formats such as FITS, CDF, etc.

FITS files: Viewpoints now has limited ability to read and write FITS files.  
When asked to read a FITS file, viewpoints will search for the first ASCII 
table extension, attempt to read it, and restore the existing data if 
unsuccessful.  When asked to write to a FITS file, it will create a new file, 
overwriting and destroying any original of the same name, and write the data 
to a single ASCII table extension in that file.  This FITS i/o capability is 
still under development and will be expanded in future revisions.

Configuration Files:

Viewpoints can save configuration information, such as axis and brush 
settings, window positions, and the name of the last input or output data 
file, to a configuration file for later reuse.  This is equivalent to saving
a snapshot of the work session.  Note that this process does not save the 
actual data or selection information itself!  If it did, this could lead to 
unnecessary duplication of the data files.  For this reason, the user must 
save any new or modified data they wish to associate with a configuration 
before they save that configuration.

Saved configurations can be loaded with or without reading their associated 
input file.  When this happens, viewpoints will attempt to use the axis
indices described in the configuration file (e.g., if the configuration
used axes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 10, viewpoints will attempt to display the
corresponding columns in the current data file).

Configuration files are saved in XML format for ease of display, but these
are not treated as conventional XML files.  In particular, due to limitations
of the BOOST serialization library, the contents of these files are order
dependant.  For this reason, any attempts to edit them should be performed
with extreme caution.

Usage:

In its current form (Version 2.2.2, build 252) 'viewpoints' is run either by 
clicking on the 'vp' icon or from the command line in the directory in which 
it has been installed or to which a path is available.  When viewpoints is 
run from the icon, it will come up with an array of default data.  When it is
run from the command line, the user must specify the input data file 
explicitly.

Apple OS X: to run viewpoints from the command line, you will probably want 
to create a shell alias to the actual executable, which is located inside the 
application bundle.  For example, if you dragged the viewpoints application 
"viewpoints.app" to your /Applications folder, then you will probably want to 
add the following to your .cshrc file (assuming you are using csh or tcsh as 
your shell):

 alias vp  /Applications/viewpoints.app/Contents/MacOS/viewpoints

A symbolic link will not work.  Use a shell alias.

If you don't care about running it from the command line, ignore the above.  
You can just double-click on the viewpoints.app icon to start it up.


The invocation for the command line version is:

 vp [optional arguments] [optional inputfile]

 the optional arguments are:
    
  --format=ascii (default) [shortcut: -f a] 
    Read an ASCII input file that consists of a header block followed by a
    data block.  Lines in the header block are indicated by one the comment 
    characters '!', '#', or '%'.  In the absence of comment characters, the 
    header block is assumed to consist of a number of lines specified by the 
    '--skip_header' command below, with a default value of 0 lines.  The 
    first line of the data block contains the attribute names.  By default,
    this is not preceeded by a comment character and is delimited by
    whitespace, but this can be controlled from the main menu or by command
    line arguments (see --delimiter, below).  Successive lines in the data
    block contain the numeric attribute values for successive samples, 
    delimited by the delimiter character.  See the file "sampledata.txt" for 
    an example.

  --format=binary [shortcut: -f b]
    Read a binary input file.  For files that don't contain ASCII values, 
    the first record be a header that consists of a tab-delimited line of 
    ASCII attribute names ending with a newline (\n).  This will be followed 
    by a contiguous block that contains a table of binary floating point 
    values.  For files that contain ASCII values, the header will consist a
    succession of lines of ASCII text that describe the contents and provide
    ASCII lookup tables, if any, for each column of data.
    
  --format=fits [shortcut: -f f]
    Read the first ASCII table from a FITS file.  If no ASCII table is found,
    routine will assume file was empty.

  --skip_lines=<integer> [shortcut: -s <int>] (default 1)
    Specifies the number of lines that will be assigned to the header block 
    in the absence of comment characters.

  --npoints=<integer> [shortcut: -n <int>] (default min(all,3000000))
    Specifies the number of samples (records or rows in the data block of an 
    ASCII file) to read. End of file will terminate read.  Note the default:
    if you want to read more than 3 million samples, you must say so using 
    this argument.

  --rows=<integer> [shortcut: -r <int>] (default 2)
    Specifies the number of rows of scatterplots

  --cols=<integer> [shortcut: -c <int>] (default 2)
    Specifies the number of columns of scatterplots

  --input_file=<filespec> [shortcut: -i <filespec>]
    Filespec of the input file.  NOTE: if this parameter is not specified, 
    the code will assume that the final token in the command line is the 
    input filespec.

  --commented_labels [shortcut -L]
    Assume that column labels are contained in the last commented line 
    before the data block -- i.e., the last line of the header block.
    Default behavior is to read column labels from the first (uncommented) 
    line of the data block.

  --config_file=<filespec> [shortcut: -C <filespec>]
    Filespec of a saved configuration file.  NOTE: If this parameter is 
    specified, it will override any input filespec.

  --borderless [shortcut: -b]
    Attempt to maximize plot windows' usable area by removing window manager 
    decorations.  Note: this seems to cause problems with keyboard shortcuts 
    in plot windows under Mac OSX.

  --help [shortcut: -h]
    Print a short help message.

  --ordering={rowmajor,columnmajor}
    ordering for binary data, default=columnmajor

  --nvars [shortcut -v <int>]
    The number of variables (attributes) per sample is automatically 
    determined from the last header line in an ascii input file, or from the 
    first line of a column-major binary file.  This option is only for row 
    major binary data, in which case one must also specfiy --npoints above.

  --delimiter [shortcut -d=<char>]
    interpret char as field separator, default is whitespace.  Delimiter 
    characters can be escaped using the standard c-language convetions. This 
    delimiter is also used in the header to delimit variable (attribute) 
    names.
    e.g.  --delimiter=,  for comma delimited
    or    --delimter=\t  for tab delimited
    
  --missing_values [shortcut -M <number>]
    set the value of any unreadable, nonnumeric, empty, or missing values to 
    NUMBER, default=0.0.  NOTE: if you use the default delimiter (whitespace) 
    then lines with one or more missing values are skipped and so this 
    option has no effect. 

  --no_vbo [shortcut -B]
    don't use openGL vertex buffer objects.  Useful if you have an older 
    graphics card or if the graphics are inconsistent or very slow.  May be
    useful if you are attempting to look at huge datasets.

  --preserve_data=(T,F) [shortcut: -P <string>] (default TRUE)
    Preserve existing data for restoration if a read operation fails.  Turn
    this off to reduce memory usage for extremely karge data sets.

  --stdin [shortcut -I]
    read input data from stdin.  This allows piping on systems that support 
    it.
    e.g.   tail -n 100 bigfile | awk '{print $0 " " $3/$2}' | vp --stdin
  
  --trivial_columns=(T,F) [shortcut: -t <string>] (default TRUE)
    Removes columns with a single value

  --verbose [shortcut -O]
    print verbose output with additional diagnostics
    
  --version [shortcut -V]
    print version information and then exit.
    
  --expert [shortcut -x]
    enable expert mode, that bypasses confirmations and allows reads from
    stdin, etc.

  --help [shortcut -h]
    print out brief usage message and then exit.


When 'viewpoints' is invoked, it will read the input file, then display a 
control panel along with an 'r' x 'c' array of linked scatter plots.  These 
windows can be moved and resized in the conventional fashion.  If you delete 
some window by accident, you can restore every window using the 'reload 
plots' command. (If you delete every plot window, the program may crash).

You can also select a particular plot by giving it the mouse focus directly, 
or by clicking on its associated tab in the control panel window.  Within 
different windows, you can use the mouse to select portions of the data set.  
It is in this feature that the power of 'viewpoints' resides.  Rather than 
attempt to describe it in detail, we encourage you to experiment!

Controls in the control panels:

 The control panel consists of a set of tabbed control panels for individual 
 windows, tabbed control panels for individual brushes, and a main control 
 panel for the entire array of panels.  For the most part, these controls 
 should be intuitive.  Some of these controls are described below:

 Tabbed control panels for individual windows:

                        value in y.  The width of this bin is controlled the 
                        number of histogram bins, N bins.)

Notes and warnings:

The current release of the 'viewpoints' package (version 2.2.2, build 252) is 
still a development version.  While every effort has been make to ensure that 
it will work -- or fail gracefully if it doesn't -- it still has many rough 
edges.  Some of these are described below.  These issues will all be 
addressed in future releases.

1) If you drag a window over the main control panel, the main control panel
may need to be refreshed.  This can be accomplished by resizing it.

2) The Load and Save Configuration commands are a comparatively new feature.
For this reason, they are still evolving.  While every effort has been made 
to ensure that old configuration files are upward-compatible with new 
versions of viewpoints, it is advisable to resave a new version of these 
files if the package warns you to do so.

3) The FITS file i/o capability is new, and is not yet guaranteed to work on 
every system.  It will undergo substantial improvement in future releases.

4) The Edit Column Labels tool is still under development, and can produce
unexpected behavior.  It is not guaranteed to preserve axis or scaling 
information, and in the current release can only delete labels.  For ASCII
files, column labels can be renamed via by using an editor in a conventional 
fashion.  Small binary files can be saved to ASCII and edited.  For large 
binary files, it is possible, with difficulty, to rename labels by saving a 
small portion of the file as ASCII, editing this, reloading it, and appending 
the remaining portion of the original binary file.

5) For a variety of reasons related to platform-independance and formatting
of multiple windows, there is, as yet, no 'print' command.  Images can be 
saved for use as screenshots in a conventional fashion using the relevant OS 
commands.
